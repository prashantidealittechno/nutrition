Clarification of foreign key relationships is needed as the textual description of "this table links to that table" does not specify direction and sometimes refers to tables that do not hold the unique key. Here are the tables that define the keys that can be linked to (T.c means anywhere column c is used, it must relate back to T.c as a foreign key, except for table T itself):
- DATA_SRC.DataSrc_ID
- DERIV_CD.Deriv_Cd
- FD_GROUP.FdGrp_Cd
- FOOD_DES.NDB_No (also used for Ref_NDB_No)
- LANGDESC.Factor_Code
- NUTR_DEF.Nutr_No
- SRC_CD.Src_Cd


Modifications made that were missing or incorrect in the data description file ./data/sr28_doc.pdf:

All tables:
- The original table data files are unchanged, but because during data import MySQL cannot handle trailing spaces and Oracle cannot handle trailing line feed characters (^M), the original "data/<table>.txt" files were copied to "data/<table>.txt.trimmed" files and processed further to remove all trailing whitespace on every line and empty lines altogether.

DATA_SRC table
- Number of records = 682 instead of 681.

FOOTNOTE table
- Number of records = 552 instead of 553.
- (MySQL) convert empty string Nutr_No values to null to avoid foreign key error added on FOOTNOTE table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 387: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_48'>,

  + the error above occurs with this statement: alter table FOOTNOTE add foreign key (Nutr_No) references NUTR_DEF(Nutr_No)
  + "select distinct Nutr_No from FOOTNOTE order by Nutr_No" reveals there's an empty value, which the NUTR_DEF table does not contain

NUT_DATA table
- (MySQL) convert empty string Deriv_Cd values to null to avoid foreign key error added on NUT_DATA table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 368: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_44'>,

NUTR_DEF table
- NUTR_DEF.txt contains non-ASCII characters (the mcg symbol). This is not corrected, so the actual value in the DB may not be the right character.

WEIGHT table:
- Change the size of Amount from 5.3 to 6.3 to accommodate these records (remember, n.m means n digits total with m decimal places):
  ~14260~^1^240^~ml~^240^1^
  ~14276~^2^200^~ml~^200^1^

- Change the size of Num_Data_Pts from 3 to 4 to accommodate these records:
  ~07254~^2^1^~slice 12 oz pkg~^16^1329^
  ~07973~^1^1^~slice~^8.1^1587^
  ~07973~^2^1^~raw pr g~^15^1627^
